Rosalind Project website: http://rosalind.info/about/

My Rosalind profile: http://rosalind.info/users/harel/

###Repository legend
----

In the top level directory you can find all of the python scripts used for solving each of the problems

Solutions are named numericaly in order they appear, followed by the section name which they are in (Python Village, Bioinformatics Stronghold, etc.) followed by the problem id. 
The title of the problem is in the commit message for each script.

The data and output files are located in the respective subdirectories and are named using the same method as above.

You can easily search for any problem by using the problems unique Id which is contained in the file name (INI1, INI2, etc.)
