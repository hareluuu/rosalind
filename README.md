###Repository legend

In the top level directory you can find all of the python scripts used for solving each of the problems

Solutions are named numericaly in order they appear, followed by the section name which they are in (Python Village, Bioinformatics Stronghold, etc.) followed by the problem id. 
The title of the problem is in the commit message for each script.

The data and output files are located in the respective subdirectories and are named using the same method as above.
